I have two domains: https://samprovidence.com and http://codyboppert.com

Samprovidence has a neat example of Sierpinski's triangle on it at the moment and a nice header photo.
It shall be used for any writings I may do.

Codyboppert will be a personal profile with a small side blog. There's nothing there at the moment.

The goal is to eventually have two professional quality websites beautiful from the code on up.

Some of the features I'd like to eventually implement are comments, word clouds, and search.

Brainstorming. Planning. Research. Design. Build.
Simplified with lots of overlap but I appear to be somewhere before the design phase.
